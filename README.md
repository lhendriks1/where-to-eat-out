## Summary
Helps users plan going out to eat. The app takes user input for location and desired cuisine. Results include venue name, address, photo, and a list of suggested next venues.

## Motivation
I love eating out and trying new restaurants. I wanted to take some of the 'thinking' out of figuring out where to get food and where to go afterwards.

## Tech
Built with HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, & foursquare API
